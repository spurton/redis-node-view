This is a web view for Distributed::Redis: [Redis::Distributed Ruby Doc]: http://rubydoc.info/gems/redis/2.1.1/Redis/Distributed which is a module included in the Ruby Redis client. Here is more info about it: [Sharding Redis Is Easy]: http://artemyankov.com/sharding-redis-is-easy/

The web UI allows you to page through each node in the hash ring and get information about the node. As well as the ability to search for a key which will return the node where the key resides as well as storage information about the key.
